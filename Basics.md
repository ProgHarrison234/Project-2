# Project
We are looking at making a custom computer building website. WE are looking to have as many features as we can including a pricing of parts from Newegg (for now, if we have time to add more with comparison), checkboxes for when a part is bought for the build, pricing of build total and so on
# What needs to be done
1 - handlebars
2 - api (Nick is looking at Newegg)
3 - schema
4 - api-routes
5 - mvc
